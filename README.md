# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on multiple financial and personal factors. The model is built using Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) and deployed with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

# Brief

With the growing need for automated financial risk assessment, predicting loan approval is a critical task for lending institutions.
This project builds a machine learning classification model that uses applicants’ financial records, credit history, and asset values to determine whether their loan will be approved (1) or rejected (0).



# DataSet

The dataset used in this project is the [Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset)) from Kaggle. It includes key applicant information such as ***income, dependents, CIBIL score, loan amount, term, and asset values.***

# How_It_Works

- Load and clean the dataset (handle missing values, strip column names, remove unnecessary features). 
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and run **ANOVA tests** to check feature importance.
- Apply ***SMOTE*** to balance the dataset (handle loan approval imbalance).  
- Scale numerical features using ***StandardScaler***.  
- Train a ***Logistic Regression model*** with ***GridSearchCV*** to tune hyperparameters (`C`, `penalty`, `solver`, `class_weight`).  
- Evaluate the model using ***accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score***.
- Save the trained model, scaler, and feature list using ***pickle***.
- Deploy a ***Streamlit app*** that allows users to input loan application details and get predictions instantly.   


# Tools & Libraries

I. Jupyter Notebook & VS Code  
II. Python 3.x  
III. pandas, numpy  
IV. matplotlib, seaborn  
V. scikit-learn  
VI. imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

VIII. Streamlit 


# Model_Performance

The Logistic Regression model was tuned and evaluated on the test set.  
Evaluation results showed:  

- **Accuracy:** 93.78%  
- **Classification Report:**  

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0 (Rejected) | 0.97 | 0.93 | 0.95 | 521 |
| 1 (Approved) | 0.89 | 0.96 | 0.92 | 315 |
| **Overall Accuracy** | **0.94** | | | 836 |
| **Macro Avg** | 0.93 | 0.94 | 0.93 | 836 |
| **Weighted Avg** | 0.94 | 0.94 | 0.94 | 836 |

This indicates that the model can generalize well and provide meaningful predictions on new loan applications.
